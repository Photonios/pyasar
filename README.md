# PyAsar
Python 3 library for working with Electron's ASAR archive files. Electron (formely known as Atom Shell) uses it's own archive format to compress files into a single file. The format is somewhat similar to TAR files. There's a Node.JS package for working with ASAR files:

The URL above also contains the format documentation.
